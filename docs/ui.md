# UI
Considering a UI that will visualise the JVM, allowing:

* Stepping through opcode by opcode
* Displaying all the code (opcodes) for a class
* Breakpoints on opcodes
* See the operand stack, and variables
* See the class constants
* Debug log output on what an opcode is doing

This can also act as a debugger.
